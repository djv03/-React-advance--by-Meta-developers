//this is the intro to the useeffect hook 

//but first let us understand why we need it in the first place?

//so there is 2 type of function

//pure function: get same output on same input for no matter how mant time we ran it
//impure function: has some part of it which is depended on the outer of the function ex: console.log, geolocation

//so useEffect hook is used to hadle those "impurities " in functions
